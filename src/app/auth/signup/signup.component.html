    <!-- This code snippet is an example of an HTML template that uses a custom component called "app-input".

The <app-input> component is being used to create an input field for the user to enter their username.

The inputType attribute is set to "text", indicating that the input field should accept plain text input.
The label attribute is set to "Username", which will be displayed as a label for the input field.
The [control] property is binding the value of the input field to the result of the authForm.get('username') expression. It is likely that authForm is a form group or form control object that is used to manage and validate form data. By binding the input field to this expression, any changes made to the input field will update the corresponding property in the form control object.
Overall, this code snippet is creating an input field for the username using a custom component and binding it to a form control object for further processing. -->

    <app-input inputType="password" label="Password" [control]="getFormControl('password')"></app-input>
